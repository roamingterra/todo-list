// taskCategory factory function (creates task category objects, which will contain tasks)
// properties: title (received from user form), color (received from user form), array of tasks
// methods: getTitle, getColor, getTasks (get tasks from tasks array), setTitle, setColor, setTask (add task to tasks array),

// task factory function (creates tasks that the user creates, which will be placed in a taskCategory)
// properties: title (received from user form), description (received from user form),
//             category (received from user form), dueDate (received from user form),
//             priority (received from user form)
// methods: getTitle, getDescription, getCategory, getDueDate, getPriority
//          setTitle, setDescription, setCategory, setDueDate, setPriority

// today array (contains all task objects that have dueDate of todays date)

// late array (contains all task objects that have a dueDate earlier that todays date)

// setComplete function (sets task as complete and deletes it from all arrays that contain it)
// This function performs an animation before deleting it unlike the next function...

// deleteTask function (deletes task from all arrays that contains it)

// addTask function (receives data from the user form and calls the task factory function, feeding it the user parameters)
// ***This may not be needed***

// organizeTask function (sends task object to appropriate arrays)
// NOTE: Something to consider is that when a new day comes along, certain task objects will need to be automatically
//       placed into either the today array, or the late array.

// editTask function (receives data from user form, then calls task set methods to change the appropriate properties)

// changeTheme function (changes UI to dark mode or light mode )
